Running the application with the wiimote:
  After installing the wiimote dependencies -- mainly pybluez.

  Cache the wiimote id:
    While in the flTile directory, run ../flWii/detectAndCacheMote.py
       Then press the 1 & 2 button on the wiimote simultaneously.
    After the script finishes, it will display any wiimotes that it detected.
       It will also store wiimote ids in a file: "mote.cache".

  Run the flTile application normally:  (no extra wii parameter is needed)
     example: sh mpiTileArg.sh myimage.png 
     Pressing 1 & 2 buttons will let the wiimote connect.
     To save batteries, the application will disconnect the wiimote after
        a minute or so inactivity (i.e. when no infrared light is visible).
     The "-" button also forces a disconnection.

  Multiple wiimotes:
     Pressing "+" will change the number of wiimotes that are to be
        connected.  It cycles through the numbers 1 through 4.  The
        current value is printed to stdout for now.
        It's useful because actively trying to connect to 4 wiimotes
        when only using 1 can impact performance a little.
     
    

Debugging use of the Wiimote:
  There are a few scripts in the flWii directory for testing.
  irViewBasic.py is a good test that will shows the infrared leds that the 
      wiimote is detecting.
