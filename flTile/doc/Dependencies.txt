Dependencies

Install all the software below on all tile display machines.

Prepared packages are of course easiest.  If the os doesn't have a package 
  for a dependency,  you'll likely have to retrieve the source and do a 
  "make install" into an alternate directory.  Then copy that directory to all
  tile display machines.

The debian/ubuntu names of dependencies are listed below:
Often packaged:
  mpich-bin
  libmpich1.0-dev
  pygame
  bluetooth    (for the wiimote)
