Run from the flTile directory.

mpirun -np 8 -machinefile /home/eolson/am-macs/machinefile /home/eolson/am-macs/local/bin/pyMPI tileImage.py $*

mpiTileArg.sh is a good example start script.
 It is used like this:
    sh mpiTileArg.sh out.png

It basically contains one line that does this:
  mpirun -np 8 -machinefile machinefile pyMPI tileImage.py out.png


Instead of specifying a single image to load, you can also specify a directory
    containing images, movies, or tiled movies.


----------------------
Troubleshooting:
  1) make sure a basic opengl window can be opened.
       cd flapp/test
       python test3D.py    (a very simple unshaded cube will show up)

  2) ... to be continued
