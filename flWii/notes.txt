The IR sensor returns values in the range 0..1023 * 0..767. Measurements indicate that the horizontal field of view is approximately 41°, the vertical field of view approximately 31°. This means that one increment corresponds to 0.04° or 25 increments correspond to one degree both in horizontal and in vertical direction.

0x31 is motion sensor, 0x32 is IR camera (???), and 0x33 is both IR camera and motion sensor. 

IR bytes: 10, 12, 36

10:  range 0-1023 for the X dimension, and 0-767 for Y
     Each location is encoded in 10 bits
